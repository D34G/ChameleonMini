Chameleon-Mini
==============
This is the NOT official repository of ChameleonMini, a freely programmable, portable tool for NFC security analysis that can emulate and clone contactless cards, read RFID tags and sniff/log RF data. Thanks to over 1700 backers from our [Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1980078555/chameleonmini-a-versatile-nfc-card-emulator-and-mo), the current Revision G has been realized by Kasper & Oswald GmbH.

Our Project is based on the open-source project by ChameleonMini RevG by Kasper & Oswald [Webshop](https://shop.kasper.it/). 

Our ChameleonMini / ChameleonTiny by ProxGrind is available on Indiegogo now.
